# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v4.0.0 (2023-05-10)

### What's new

- Statamic 4 support #59
- Aligned the Duplicate action with recent changes in the Core action (added authorization, fixed for collections without slugs)

## v3.0.0 (2023-02-14)

This addon is _back_! The Duplicator addon was merged into Statamic Core a few months ago. However, it doesn't yet support multi-sites.

If you need to update your multi-site and keep Duplicator, you can now keep this addon:

- The Assets/Form duplicate actions will be handled by Statamic.
- The Entry/Term duplicate actions will be handled by this addon, in the same way they were handed previously.

Please also give a 👍 reaction to the feature request on [statamic/ideas](https://github.com/statamic/ideas/issues/942).
